----- THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT GUIDE FOR *handbook frontend* PROJECT -----

*Any line have the structure -- abc -- means that it's the description (without -- -- )*

1. Copy the "Local.Properties.Build.Template" and remove ".Template" to "Local.Properties.Build" file.

2. Edit "Local.Properties.Build" file, with the following information:

	<!-- Needed to run the UpgradeDb_local.bat -->
    <property name="Database.Server.Local" value="-- Database Server Address (ex: localhost) --" />
    <property name="Database.DataSource.Local" value="-- Database name to work with (ex: mydatabase) --" />
    <property name="Database.User.Local" value="-- User id has the full right on Database Server (ex: sa) --" />
    <property name="Database.Password.Local" value="-- Password of above user --" />
	
	<!-- Needed to run the UpgradeDb_staging.bat -->
	<property name="Database.Server.Staging" value="" />
    <property name="Database.DataSource.Staging" value="" />
    <property name="Database.User.Staging" value="" />
    <property name="Database.Password.Staging" value="" />
	
3. In "Build" folder, open "Command prompt", you have multiple commands to run

	build db.upgrade.local		: Upgrade the database with latest schemas.
	build db.upgrade.staging	: Upgrade the database on staging server with latest schemas.
	build unit.tests			: Run the unit tests (if any)
	build source				: Build the solution (similar to Build solution in VS)
	build all					: Run combination of "config", "source", "unit.tests"
	build						: Display above instructions.
	
	- For the optimistic case, you should see BUILD SUCCEEDED at the end of build command.
		
4. Upgrade script
	- Any upgrade in database should be added in Database\Upgrades\Upgrade_01.00.00.xxx.sql (with xxx is the latest number + 1)
	- The structure of the upgrade script must follow this template:	
		INSERT INTO #Description VALUES('-- Upgrade Script Description --')
			GO
			-- Script content --
	- After a sprint or phrase, we should add all the script to Upgrade_01.00.01.000.sql and make it to baseline script, and next upgrade script should be named Upgrade_01.00.01.xxx.sql (with xxx is start from 1 and is the lastest number + 1)

5.	Upgrade database
	-We can upgrade database by follow the instructions in [3]
	-The other way is run UpgradeDb_local.bat to upgrade local databse and Upgrade_staging.bat to upgrade server staging database
